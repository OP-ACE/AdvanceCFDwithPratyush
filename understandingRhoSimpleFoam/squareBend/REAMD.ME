This test case might show error while solving the equations. Because we have applied only simple version of rhoSimpleFoam.
In next tutorial, we are going to compare the standard solver 'rhoSimpleFoam' and our developed solver 'understandingRhoSimpleFoam' ;and we will create the test case for the same.Also we will se how to handle Foam::sigFpe::sigHandler error.
